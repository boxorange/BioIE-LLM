# BioIE-LLM
Biological Information Extraction from Large Language Models (LLMs)

This is the official code of the papers:
* [Automated Extraction of Molecular Interactions and Pathway Knowledge using Large Language Model, Galactica: Opportunities and Challenges](https://aclanthology.org/2023.bionlp-1.22/)
* [Comparative Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models for Extracting Molecular Interactions and Pathway Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08813)


## Installation
The code was implemented on Python version 3.8, and the versions of the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt


## Datasets
* [STRING DB](https://string-db.org): the human (Homo sapiens) protein network for performing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) recognition task.
* [KEGG DB](https://www.genome.jp/kegg): the KEGG human pathways which have been identified as being activated in response to low-dose radiation exposure in [a recent study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01769).
* [INDRA DB](http://www.indra.bio): a set of human gene regulatory relation statements that represent mechanistic interactions between biological agents.


## Reproduction
To reproduce the results of the experiments, use the bash script [run.sh](scripts/run.sh). You need to change model/data paths accordingly.


## Results
Here are the results of the experiments. The experiments were conducted on 8Ã—NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Note different number of GPUs and batch size can produce slightly different results.

### Recognizing Protein-Protein Interactions ###
* STRING Task1 - Precision for the generated binding proteins for 1K protein samples.
* STRING Task2 - Micro F-scores for randomly selected positive and negative pairs (I.e., 1K = 500 pos + 500 neg).
* Model prediction consistency between Task1 and Task2.

### KEGG Pathway Recognition ###
* KEGG Task1 - Precision for the generated genes that belong to the top 20 pathways relevant to low-dose radiation exposure.
* KEGG Task2 - Micro F-scores for randomly selected positive and negative pairs (I.e., 1K = 500 pos + 500 neg).
* Model prediction consistency between Task1 and Task2.
